- 👋 Hi, I’m @amrita-pc

- 👀 I’m interested in learning about Android, penetration testing, Linux.
I'd also like to learn about the basics of web development.
- Last year for Halloween I set up a Magic Mirror from a RPi where you could scan a QR code
and enter a message of your choice to be displayed on the Mirror. 
- Hoping to resurrect this before Christmas and add Xmas flair to it

- In the spirit of festivals, I wrote a bash script for Christmas last year to allocate partners for Secret Santa.
However the script kept pairing couples together so was abandoned. The good news is the Secret Santa still went ahead.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my life better on Linux Mint

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects you think I would be a good fit for
