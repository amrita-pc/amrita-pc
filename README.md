- 👋 Hi, I’m @amrita-pc
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about Android, penetration testing, Linux
- Last year for Halloween I set up a Magic Mirror from a RPi where you could scan a QR code and enter a message of your choice to be displayed on the Mirror. 
- Hoping to resurrect this before Christmas and add Xmas flair to it
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my life better on Linux Mint
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects you think I would be a good fit for
