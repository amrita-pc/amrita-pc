- 👋 Hi, I’m @amrita-pc

- 👀 I’m interested in learning about Android, penetration testing, Linux.
I'd also like to learn about the basics of web development.
- Last year for Halloween I set up a Magic Mirror from a RPi where you could scan a QR code
and enter a message of your choice to be displayed on the Mirror. 
- Hoping to resurrect this before Christmas and add Xmas flair to it
- In the spirit of festivals, for Christmas last year, I wrote a bash script to allocate partners for Secret Santa.
However the script kept pairing couples together so was abandoned. The good news is the Secret Santa still went ahead.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to make my life better on Linux Mint

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects you think I would be a good fit for
